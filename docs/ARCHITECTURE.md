# Architecture

Transport Fever 2 has no multiplayer code. This project adds **lockstep** multiplayer from
the outside: every player runs the same simulation from the same save, and the only thing that
travels is player commands, each applied at the same simulation step on every machine. The
game's simulation is deterministic enough for that (two instances fed the same inputs stay
identical; see [re/GAME_LOOP_AND_UI.md](re/GAME_LOOP_AND_UI.md#threads-and-state)), and a
detector checks it continuously while people play.

## Components

```
TransportFever2.exe
  alut.dll ............... forwarding proxy for the game's own alut_real.dll; loads the four DLLs below
  tpf2_bridge_mp.dll ..... identity, command lines to and from the lobby, sim-loop hooks   <-> tpf2_capture/events_<L>.txt
  tpf2_menu.dll .......... Multiplayer panel, lobby launcher, save placement, forced saves   <-> netpunch lobby_*.jsonl
  tpf2_slice.dll ......... captures the player's commands and cancels them                  -> lockstep_inject_<L>.txt
  tpf2_pluginhost.dll .... loads plugins (none in this repository; TpF2 Big Maps is one)
  mods/mp_lockstep_1 ..... Lua game script: stamps, ships, replays, paces, detects divergence
netpunch.exe ............. the lobby (separate process): NAT traversal, sealed transport, save transfer
```

| component | source | job |
|---|---|---|
| proxy | `native/src/proxy_alut.cpp` | The game imports `alut.dll` statically, so the proxy is loaded at process start. It forwards all 20 exports to `alut_real.dll` and, from a thread started in `DllMain`, loads the bridge, menu, slice and plugin-host DLLs, each from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tpf2mp\` if present, else from its own folder. |
| bridge | `native/src/bridge_main.cpp`, `net.cpp`, `speedhook.cpp` | Elects and records the instance identity (`tpf2_instance.txt`), tails the mod's capture file and sends each line over its UDP link, writes received lines to the events file, follows `tpf2_bridge_ctl.txt`, and hooks the sim loop for fractional speed. It has no settings file. The UDP socket is bound to 127.0.0.1 in lobby sessions and drops datagrams that are not from its peer. |
| slice | `native/src/slice_hook.cpp` | Hooks the `make_cmd::*` factories and `CommandList::Add`. Decodes a player's command, writes it to the inject file, and cancels the native command when a session is live. Welds the template connector into replayed construction proposals. Checks the exe's build before patching; only one instance per Windows session gets it (a named mutex). |
| menu | `native/src/menu_hook.cpp` | Adds a Multiplayer entry to the title menu's list and draws the panel into the game's Vulkan frames (GDI-rendered into an opaque sheet, composed only when the panel changes and blitted every frame; it is never composited over a read-back of the frame, which cost 40-65 ms per frame). Runs `netpunch.exe` in a job object, tails its events, writes `tpf2_bridge_ctl.txt` and `mp_company_cfg.txt`, places the shared save, forces the game's autosave for hot joins and relay uploads, fetches the public list, and adds the mod to new games' mod list. |
| plugin host | `native/src/plugin/` | Loads `*.dll` from `plugins\` in the data folder, then in the game folder, and calls their `Tpf2mpPluginInit` export (ABI 1). The multiplayer DLLs are not plugins. |
| mod | `mod/mp_lockstep_1` | `lockstep.lua` plus modules in `res/scripts/mp/`: turns captures into position-based commands, stamps and ships them, replays everyone's commands through the game-script API, keeps the clocks together, detects divergence, runs companies mode and the in-game Multiplayer window. |
| lobby | `netpunch/` | See [NETWORKING.md](NETWORKING.md). |

## A player's action, end to end

Building a road, with other players connected:

1. **Capture.** The street tool calls `make_cmd::BuildProposal`. The slice's factory hook reads
   the proposal (nodes, edges, tangents, types, removed edges), appends `ARMED 1` and a `ROADE`
   line to `lockstep_inject_<letter>.txt`, and remembers the Command's address.
2. **Cancel.** The tool then calls `CommandList::Add` with that Command. The slice's Add hook
   recognises it, fires the tool's completion callback (the tool waits for it), zeroes Add's
   output handle and skips the call. The road is now built nowhere.
3. **Stamp and ship.** The mod reads the inject file every tick. While this game still has the
   entities, it converts ids to positions (`ROADP`), then `CM.scheduleLocal` gives the command
   a sequence number and a stamp: now + `EXEC_DELAY` (0.4) + how far the fastest other player's
   clock is ahead (at most 15), rounded up to the 0.2 sim-step grid. It queues the command
   locally and appends `LSCMD op=ROADP at=<stamp> origin=<letter> seq=<n> ... params=...` to
   `tpf2_capture_<letter>.txt`.
4. **Transport.** The bridge sends the line to its lobby process over loopback UDP; the lobbies
   carry it to every other player; each receiving bridge appends it to
   `tpf2_events_<letter>.txt`. Between a bridge and its lobby a line travels in the bridge's own
   framing: chunks of up to 1,023 bytes, each UDP packet only as long as its chunk (at most 1,086
   bytes).
5. **Receive.** Each mod reads its events file every tick, tracks per-sender sequence gaps, and
   queues the command.
6. **Apply.** Every tick each instance sorts its queue by (stamp, sender letter, sequence) and
   applies each command whose stamp step has been reached, the sender's own copy included:
   `execPolyline` resolves the positions against its own world and submits the road through
   `api.cmd.make.buildProposal` / `api.cmd.sendCommand`.
7. **Check.** At common stamps every instance hashes the world and compares with the others
   ([REPLICATION.md](REPLICATION.md#detecting-divergence)).

Other actions follow the same shape with different capture points and replay code;
[REPLICATION.md](REPLICATION.md) lists them, including those that are not cancelled.

## Time

- **The clock is game time**, `game.interface.getGameTime().time`: it is part of the simulation
  and loaded from the same save. It advances 0.2 units per sim step.
- **Stamps are on the step grid, and commands apply by step, not by frame.** `update()` runs
  once per rendered frame, so "the first update after the stamp" is a different sim step on
  different machines. The queue compares `CM.stepOf(stamp)` with `CM.stepOf(now)`.
- **Derived targets come from agreed values only.** When a command must wait (purchases apply
  one per step; commands right after a purchase wait `BIND_GUARD_STEPS` = 10 steps; line edits
  wait 5 steps for a line created in the same batch; retries add 5 steps), the target is
  computed from stamps, which are identical everywhere, and stored as `notBeforeStep`. The
  stamp itself is never rewritten.
- **`EXEC_DELAY` must exceed the actual skew between clocks**, not a latency budget. Stamping
  past the fastest clock means a slow machine pays latency rather than forking. A command that
  arrives after its stamp is logged as `!! LATE`.

## Reliability

Game frames are best-effort in the lobby layer. Above it:

- **The bridge link** (`net.cpp`) numbers its packets, acknowledges them with a 32-bit bitmap,
  resends unacknowledged packets every 250 ms, sends a keepalive every 500 ms, and reassembles
  chunked lines in order. It tracks one remote sender at a time, though, and with three or more
  players one bridge socket hears several senders through the lobby, so its ordering and resends
  cannot be relied on there. The mod's own layer is what recovers lost commands.
- **Per-sender sequence numbers in the mod.** Every sender keeps each of its lines until every
  live peer has acknowledged past it (the heartbeat's `ak=` field: per origin, the seq through
  which that game holds every command). A receiver that sees a gap in a sender's sequence sends
  `LSNACK` after 15 ticks and again every 30 ticks (up to 10 times); the heartbeat's `hi=` field
  exposes a lost last command. The leader also answers for other senders from its history.
- **The command history is retained by need, not by count.** Every instance keeps every command
  it hears. What a joiner can ask for is bounded by the save it loads (everything stamped at or
  before the save's step is inside it), and every save handed to a joiner is at least as new as
  the last, so once a joiner reports the stamp of the save it loaded (`LSNEED ... save=1`) and the
  whole lobby roster is heard with nobody catching up, everything at or before that stamp is
  pruned. Until then it is kept in full and its size logged every 4,096 lines. A request for
  history that was pruned is answered with what is left and `hole=` on `LSHISTEND`, logged loudly
  on both ends.
- **Duplicates are harmless:** a command's `at|origin|seq` is remembered (2,048 entries).

## Pacing and game speed

- **The leader is the session clock.** It is the host (letter `a`), or in a relay lobby the
  player the relay names. It runs the **session speed** and broadcasts it (`LSEFF`, with the votes
  it counted as `vt=`).
- **The session speed is the players' vote.** While a session is live the slice cancels every
  click on a game's speed buttons and pause toggle (`UI::Clock`) and writes
  `SPEEDBTN <v> <toggle|button>` to the inject file; the Multiplayer window's speed row writes
  `SPEEDSET <v>`. A speed button or the row is that player's vote: a `SPEEDVOTE` command that every
  instance, the voter's included, records at its stamp, so no lever moves where the click was made
  and every game holds the same votes. The leader runs the session at the mean of the votes it
  counts, rounded to 0.05: its own (its speed until it votes) and those of the players it has heard
  in the last ~30 s. `/speed x` overrides the votes until the next vote lands. Only the leader's
  pause toggle pauses and resumes the session, and it is not a vote. Speed 0 is a sync point: games
  behind the leader run until they reach its clock, then stop.
- **Followers trim their own speed** around the session speed to track the leader's clock, with
  a PID controller (fixed gains, one decision every 8 ticks, 0.7-1.2x, slew limited). A follower
  more than 3 units ahead of the leader drops to a quarter of the session speed, rising as the gap
  closes. Fractional speeds are written to `tpf2_speed.txt`; the bridge's speed hook scales
  the engine's sim batch interval to match, so every iteration stays an ordinary sim step and
  the game's speed buttons never flip.
- **Load gate.** After loading, a follower holds at speed 0 until it hears the leader and then
  until it has the command history since the save it loaded (`LSNEED t=<the save's stamp> save=1`,
  the same feed a hot joiner gets; the stamp rides in the save as `savedAt`). A game that finishes
  loading after the session moved on therefore takes the hot-join path and misses nothing. There
  is no tick budget: the request is repeated whenever the feed stalls for ~5 s. The leader never
  waits. The player's override is two play presses: the first is put back and names what is
  missing, the second starts and logs that what the others did meanwhile lands out of step.
- **Catch-up.** A follower more than 8 units behind the leader asks it for the command history
  after its clock (`LSNEED`), holds until the history is complete (re-asking whenever the feed
  stalls, never running on without it), then runs at up to 4x until it is within half a unit.
  Meanwhile its heartbeat carries `cu=1` so nobody paces against it -- from its first heartbeat
  after a load until the gate has its history. The leader never catches up: it is the clock. See
  [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md#lockstep-and-pacing) for pacing rules that do not always
  behave as described.
- **Far behind, actions are off.** A stamp pays at most 15 units of lead over the fastest game, so
  a game more than 15 units behind it would stamp its player's actions into the others' past. Until
  it is back within 2 units, `inject.lua` drops every capture the slice cancelled (`ARMED 1`, and
  `CONXP`, `CONUP`, `CDEMO`) and the window's calendar and company requests, holds line creations
  until it has caught up (their editor callback waits in the slice's stash), and still ships what
  already ran natively (`ARMED 0`, `EDEMO`, `ROADC`).

## Sessions

- **Identity.** Each instance has a letter: the host is `a`, joiners are `b`, `c`, ... in roster
  order, and a relay assigns letters that stick to player names. The menu DLL writes it (with the
  loopback relay port, the player count and the leader) into `tpf2_bridge_ctl.txt`; the bridge
  records it in `tpf2_instance.txt`, which the slice and the mod read. The letter prefixes every
  command, orders ties, and namespaces placeholder ids and file names.
- **Starting.** START GAME shares the host's newest save; each joiner's menu DLL places it as
  `mp_shared.sav` and the player loads it. Only a live session cancels anything: the slice
  checks that the mod's status file is fresh and names a peer.
- **Hot join.** When a player joins a running game, the host's menu DLL forces an autosave and
  shares it like START GAME; the newcomer loads it and catches up from the leader's command
  history. See [NETWORKING.md](NETWORKING.md#hot-join).
- **Dedicated relay.** The same flow with a server in the middle that holds the latest world; see
  [NETWORKING.md](NETWORKING.md#dedicated-relay).

## Companies mode

Players can play one shared company (co-op, the default) or separate companies on the same map.

- **Assignment.** Each player picks a company chip in the lobby. At START the menu DLL writes
  `mp_company_cfg.txt`: the mode (`companies` when more than one chip is in use), this player's
  company, the roster, and the letter-to-company map. The map is authoritative: an incoming
  command's company is taken from it, not from the sender.
- **Engine players.** Each other company is a real engine player (`game.interface.addPlayer`) with
  its own wallet. Commands carry their company; builds are reassigned to the company's player
  (`setPlayer`, and locked against other companies' bulldozers), their cost is moved with journal
  entries, vehicles are bought as the company's player, new lines and loans are attributed to it.
- **In game.** The Multiplayer window's companies block can create a company, switch to another
  (with an optional password, compared as a salted hash), and set a password. `CMNEW`, `CMSWITCH`,
  `CMPW` and `CMDEL` apply at the stamp on every instance. Switching swaps the owned entities and
  wallets between the human player and the company's engine player on your machine.
- **Saved state.** The mode, roster, letter map, passwords and engine player ids ride in the save
  (the mod's `save()`/`load()`), so a reloaded session keeps its companies.

## Files

All runtime files are in the data folder, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tpf2mp\data\` (the environment variable
`TPF2MP_DATADIR` overrides it), unless noted. `<L>` is the instance letter.

The mod's own log lines (`[ls-<L>] ...`) go to the game's stdout,
`<Steam>\userdata\<steamid>\1066780\local\crash_dump\stdout.txt`, which the game truncates at
launch and writes out when it exits.
