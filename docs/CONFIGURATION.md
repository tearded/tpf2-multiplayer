# Configuration

Multiplayer needs no settings. Every replication channel and the pacing are built in, so a
missing, old or damaged settings file cannot switch part of the protocol off, or put one player on
a different protocol from the others. The files below hold diagnostics, one latency setting, panel
preferences and plugin settings.

## Files and where they are read from

| file | read by | where | changes take effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tpf2_slice.cfg` | slice DLL (`dumpprop`), the mod (`dump_egeo`, `exec_delay`) | the game folder (for the slice, next to `tpf2_slice.dll`), else the data folder | `dumpprop` within 2 s, `dump_egeo` within about 5 s, `exec_delay` when a game loads |
| `tpf2_menu_flags.txt` | menu DLL | next to `tpf2_menu.dll` (the game folder) only | at game start |
| `tpf2mp.cfg` | plugin host | the game folder, else the data folder | at game start |

- The bridge DLL has no settings file; a `tpf2_bridge_mp.cfg` left from an older version is ignored.
- The data folder is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tpf2mp\data\` ([Environment](#environment)).
- **The first file found wins; files are never merged.** A copy in the data folder is ignored while
  the game folder has one, and the installer puts the game-folder `tpf2_slice.cfg` back on every
  upgrade and Repair ([installer/README.md](../installer/README.md#upgrading)).

## `tpf2_slice.cfg`

The installer's copy has every key commented out.

| key | read by | default | effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dumpprop` | slice | 0 | `1` dumps every construction and road proposal to `tpf2_slice.log` (verbose): for a replay the engine rejects without a message. |
| `dump_egeo` | mod | off | `1` writes every edge the desync hash sees to `egeo_<letter>.txt` in the game folder, to diff two instances after a divergence (ignore the first line, a per-instance stamp). |
| `exec_delay` | mod | auto | How far ahead every command is stamped, in game-time units, snapped up to the 0.2 step grid: the latency of every action. **Auto** (no value, or anything that is not a number): it starts at 0.4 and follows the measured round trip to each player (heartbeat echoes), rising at once when a connection slows and falling one step at a time when it recovers, within 0.4-3 (0.4 is the floor: a command is only read on the receiver's next script tick, about one step, and at 0.4 ~5% already arrive with no time to spare); the stats show `command delay` and `round trip`. A number from 0.2 to 5 pins it instead. Every received command logs `spare=`, the game time it had left before its stamp (`!! LATE` when negative). |

The two readers parse differently:

- **Slice:** a line that is exactly `dumpprop=1` or `dumpprop=0` from its first character, optionally
  followed by blanks. Any other line is ignored, and the last valid line wins.
- **Mod:** `key=value`, with blanks allowed before the key and around the `=`. `dump_egeo` is on for
  `1`, `true` or `yes`.
- A line starting with `#` matches neither, so it works as a comment.

## `tpf2_menu_flags.txt`

Not shipped; create it next to `tpf2_menu.dll`. One `key=value` per line, keys case-sensitive, no
blanks before the `=`. Unknown keys are ignored, and a value that fails its check leaves that
setting at its default.

| key | default | accepted | effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `master_url` | `https://srv1306562.hstgr.cloud/tpf2mp` (the project's master server) | empty, or an `http://` or `https://` URL without blanks or quotes (a trailing `/` is dropped) | Base URL of the public game list. The panel reads `<url>/list`, and a host with PUBLIC ticked announces to it. Empty hides the list and the PUBLIC checkbox. |
| `relay_autosave_min` | 2 | 0-60 | How often, in minutes, a relay lobby's leader uploads a fresh save while playing; `0` never. |
| `autoload` | 1 | `0`, `1` | `1`: the shared save loads by itself after START GAME. `0`: the player loads it with LOAD GAME. |
| `share_mods` | `ask` | `ask`, `always`, `never` | Only matters when a host runs the lobby with `--share-mods` (mod sharing is off by default): mods the shared save needs and you lack. `ask` shows a YES / NO in the panel when the host presses START GAME (no answer in 90 s counts as no), `always` downloads without asking, `never` declines. |
| `slot` | 0 | 0-7 | Position of the Multiplayer entry in the title menu's list (0 = top). |
| `scale` | 0 | 0.5-3 | Panel scale; 0 = screen height / 1080. |
| `automod` | on | a line starting `automod=0` | Stops the panel adding the Transport Fever 2 Multiplayer mod to the game's default mod list. |
| `sharedstations` | on | a line starting `sharedstations=0` | Read by the slice DLL, not the menu. Off leaves the line editor's owner check alone, so in companies mode another company's station cannot be put on your line (see SHARED_INFRA.md). |

The slice DLL reads the same file — next to itself first, then in the data dir — for its own
`<key>=0` switches (`trainorder`, `roadspace`, `shiporder`, `airorder`, `sharedstations`); each one
turns off a single guarded patch and says so in `tpf2_slice.log` at startup.

## `tpf2mp.cfg` and plugin settings

The plugin host's file, not installed by the MSI. `[section]` headers (a plugin's section is its DLL
name without `.dll`), `key=value` lines with whitespace trimmed, keys case-insensitive; `#` or `;` only at
the start of a line starts a comment, so values may contain them. Booleans take `1/0`, `true/false`,
`yes/no`, `on/off`.

- The host itself reads one key: `enabled` in each plugin's section (default on; `enabled=0` skips loading
  that plugin).
- The base file is `tpf2mp.cfg` in the game folder, else in the data folder. Then, for each plugin found, a
  `.cfg` with the plugin's name next to its DLL (for example `plugins\tpf2_bigmap.cfg`) is merged over the
  settings; later files win, and a plugin's file may set any section. That is how a plugin shipped by
  another installer keeps its settings without editing a file this package owns.
- Plugins are loaded from `plugins\` in the data folder first, then from `plugins\` in the game folder; a
  DLL name found in the data folder hides the game folder's copy.
- Settings are read once, at game start.

## Environment

| variable | effect |
|---|---|
| `TPF2MP_DATADIR` | Use this folder as the data folder instead of `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tpf2mp\data\`. The mod follows it only if the folder already holds `tpf2_instance.txt` (the bridge writes it at start). The lobby folder and the menu log are unaffected. |
| `TPF2MP_LOG_IPS=1` | Log IP addresses unmasked (bridge and lobby). |

## Files the software writes for itself

Not settings, but useful when reading a session: `tpf2_bridge_ctl.txt` (the menu's instructions to the
bridge and the mod: letter, loopback port, player count, session speed request, sync, leader),
`tpf2_speed.txt` (the fractional speed target), `tpf2mp_dash.txt` (window visibility),
`mp_company_cfg.txt` (company assignment) and `tpf2_names.txt` (your player and lobby names), all in the
data folder. [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#files) lists every file.
