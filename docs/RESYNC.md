# One-click recovery after a desync

Fork 0.4.24 replaces the guided recovery from release 0.4.22 with automatic
recovery. The implementation passed the local two-game acceptance tests below.

When a desync is detected, only the host can initiate recovery. With two players,
the host presses **Resync now**. With three or more, the host presses **Request
readiness**; this counts as the host's confirmation. Every client must then press
**Ready** in the same panel. It shows the ready count and starts automatically
only when every current participant has confirmed. No new save/load or recovery
hold is initiated before that point. A changed roster invalidates the request;
old confirmations cannot carry over to another request. The system then holds
all games, saves the host under a unique recovery name, transfers and verifies
that exact save set, reloads all worlds in the existing processes and compares
the freshly loaded, paused worlds. It resumes only after the shared comparison
succeeds. The host's previous speed is restored, including an intentional pause.
Changes present only on the client are replaced by the host's world.

A single compact native **Multiplayer Resync** panel appears automatically when
an in-game desync is detected. Clients initially wait for the host; the same panel shows
which of the five recovery steps is running. It disappears on successful
completion, leaving no persistent button. The ordinary Multiplayer dashboard
keeps its visibility preference and has no additional Resync section.

During native saving and loading, the custom overlay stops drawing and the
game's own loading screen remains. After a failure, the panel shows the failed
step and detail with host-only **Retry** (reusing a completed, verified snapshot when one
exists). Retry requires fresh readiness from every client in groups of three or
more. Host authority is checked against the authenticated lobby sender, including
commands that bypass the UI. There is no Cancel button: cancelling never released the input hold
and left the players unable to continue. A legacy aborted operation can still
be restarted with **Resync now**. A request temporarily disables its button;
if the host has not confirmed it after five seconds, it can be tried again.

Unsupported lobbies show an explanatory notice that can be dismissed. An active
recovery stays open until completion. To abandon recovery entirely, exit all
games normally and start a new lobby. Neither an error nor a timeout unpauses a
diverged world. Log upload preferences remain independent of recovery.

## Supported session

The current test candidate allows **two or more players in a player-hosted lobby**, all running
the same fork package, on the exact supported Windows game build 35924. A whole
executable SHA-256 check guards the build-specific native adapter. Dedicated
relays do not advertise automatic recovery. There is no recovery-specific player
limit beyond the existing lobby limit. Once recovery
has begun, the player roster is fixed; adding or replacing a player requires a
new session. Ordinary lobby start and save selection keep their existing flow.

## Implementation

- `netpunch/sync_operation.py` owns the host-authoritative barrier. Requests and
  acknowledgements name operation, revision, phase and a fresh world epoch.
  The host waits for every original participant, checks exact snapshot hashes
  and fresh paused fingerprints, and retains the hold on errors or disconnects.
- `sync_runtime.py` coordinates the local native and Lua adapters through
  PID-scoped files. Native commands require actual completion acknowledgements;
  enqueueing is not saving or loading successfully. `tpf2_sync_lua.txt` also
  carries the failed step and detail for local diagnostics.
- `sync_snapshot.py` owns immutable save bytes, requires `.sav` and `.sav.lua`,
  includes `.jpg` when present and verifies SHA-256 throughout. Unique
  `mp_<epoch-prefix>` names never overwrite unrelated user saves.
- `sync_lobby.py` uses the existing authenticated lobby and reliable save
  transport, repeats control messages, rejects duplicates and keeps recovery
  transfers separate from normal start/hot-join transfers.
- `native_io.cpp` marshals save, pause/drain and load to the observed engine UI
  thread. The native input gate stops new user commands and legacy per-frame
  script events before command creation. A FIFO pause fence drains earlier work.
- `mp/resync.lua` runs before all simulation producers and stops GUI preview
  producers too. A newly loaded Lua state reports its own fresh world token.
  A full paused world hash bypasses the normal running-only hash cadence. It
  publishes PID-scoped, fresh GUI desync notices in `tpf2_sync_notice.txt`.
  The lobby forwards these only to the local native panel; notices never start
  a recovery. Old-world notices are consumed during a hold to avoid reopening
  the panel after completion. Native buttons use the existing lobby command
  channel. Control files use per-writer temporary names so concurrent writers
  cannot lose each other's replacement.
- `net.cpp` scopes data and ACKs to a world epoch. The bridge resets queues,
  partial packets and runtime command files together. A tail read begun before
  reset cannot enqueue into the new world. Epoch requests have a separate
  `tpf2_epoch_request.txt` mailbox so roster/speed writes cannot undo a reset.
  Existing exclusive loopback binding and sender-address checks are retained.

All players need the same package: the native wire protocol is now version 4.
The save/load adapter and Lua/network barrier must be deployed together.

## Validation and limits

Automated tests cover the production Lua 5.2 pump and GUI callback; barrier,
snapshot and runtime state machines; real UDP lobby/save transfer with simulated
engines; actual native UDP epoch resets; and native IPC completion publication
under Windows sharing violations. They do not prove in-game save/load behavior.

Run `tools/resync_test.py`, `tools/test_sync_operation.py`,
`tools/test_sync_snapshot.py`, `tools/test_sync_runtime.py`,
`tools/test_auto_sync_lobby.py`, `tools/test_net_epoch.py` and
`tools/test_native_control.py`. These are required by `tools/build_release.ps1`.
The native tests require Windows and the repository MSVC environment helper.

The archived automatic implementation had successful game tests and a later
unresolved Vulkan Device-lost/MemoryException during simultaneous reloads. This
port suppresses overlay rendering during world I/O and checks overlay submission
and fence completion before reusing resources. These changes address concrete
renderer hazards; they are **not evidence that the old crash is fixed**.

Local acceptance used two real build-35924 games, matching complete candidate
packages and backed-up test saves. Four recovery operations completed, including
host and client GUI requests, speed 1, intentional pause, and a live client build
preview during the hold. All completed epochs produced identical fresh paused
fingerprints. A deliberate client-only journal change was replaced by the host
snapshot. The desync indicator was raised through the diagnostic injection path;
these cases do not claim to reproduce an organic desync.

A deliberate IPC failure after real snapshot transfer held both games. The
native retry button reused that immutable snapshot with a new epoch, without
another native save. A street built after recovery appeared in both worlds,
followed by shared SYNC. Repeated loading produced no observed game crash or
GPU error event in this run. This is a bounded local test, not a general proof
against the archived graphics failure or compatibility with every mod set.

For future changes, repeat these cases with the existing rig and compare both
worlds, logs and installed hashes. Close both games normally before replacing
DLLs, preserve test evidence before restarting, and verify the complete release
package and downloaded assets before switching the launcher feed.

The single-panel UI change has automated Lua notice, runtime and UDP regression
coverage plus an offscreen render check using the actual native panel renderer.
A subsequent local two-player run exercised this UI with an injected checksum
mismatch: the user operated and approved the panel, both worlds reloaded, both
native input gates acknowledged release, and both dashboards returned to SYNC
with zero desyncs at speed 1. Error/Retry interaction was not repeated in this run.

Three-player candidate: `tools/test_auto_sync_lobby.py --players 3` exercises
real UDP with simulated engines, including a delayed third hold, simultaneous
requests, mismatch on the third world, retry and third-player disconnect during
checking. Both remaining players retain the hold and report the disconnect.
The current test additionally verifies host-only initiation and retry, fresh
readiness for every attempt, rejection of stale confirmations, and no engine
recovery before the last participant is ready. `test_sync_readiness.py` covers
roster changes, duplicate confirmations and delayed readiness messages.
The first three-game run completed save/load and native release on all three,
but failed post-recovery connectivity: each instance heard only one peer.
The previous native transport retained a single peer session and rejected other
senders once the world epoch was nonzero. The replacement maintains independent
receive ordering, chunk assembly and ACKs for each established process. A sent
packet stays pending until every recipient present at send time acknowledges it;
timeouts never silently remove a recipient. World changes reset all streams but
preserve the established process cohort and reject stale worlds or unknown processes.

`tools/test_net_multipeer.py` compiles the production C++ transport and tests real
UDP frames from independent simulated peers with 2, 3, 5 and 8 participants across
three world resets each. Coverage includes interleaved/reordered chunks,
duplicates, per-peer ACKs, retransmission and stale world/process rejection.
The lobby recovery test also passes with 5 and 8 simulated engines, including a
delayed final participant and its disconnect. These are automated correctness
tests, not game or load tests.

The corrected local candidate subsequently passed a three-game test: host-issued
readiness progressed through 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 before recovery began. All three
completed the reload and native release, then retained both peers with fresh
ticks, SYNC, zero desyncs and speed 1. The user confirmed a subsequent construction
action appeared in all three games; the following dashboards independently showed
one applied action on each instance and continued synchronization. This validates
the tested three-player flow, not larger live groups or sustained load. The test
used an injected checksum discrepancy, not organically diverged world objects.
