Bugfix: a resync no longer gives up while the other players are still loading

Everyone in a session needs this version, and the dedicated relay runs it.

How to install

Windows (Steam, game build 35924)
1. Download `TpF2Multiplayer.msi` below.
2. Close the game and run the MSI. It installs into the game folder and the mod into the game's mods.
3. Start the game: Main menu -> Multiplayer. Installs of 0.5.7 or newer get this update offered in game; older ones install the MSI by hand.

Linux and Steam Deck (the Windows game under Proton)
1. In Steam, set Transport Fever 2 to run with Proton (Properties -> Compatibility; Proton 9 or newer), start it once and quit.
2. Download `install_proton.sh` below, close the game, and run `sh install_proton.sh`. It finds Steam, the game and the Proton prefix, downloads `TpF2Multiplayer-files.zip` from this release, checks it against `SHA256SUMS.txt` and installs; `--dry-run` shows the plan first. It needs only bash, curl, sha256sum and unzip. (`install_proton.py` does the same with Python 3.9 or newer: `python3 install_proton.py`.)
3. Start the game: Main menu -> Multiplayer. Full guide: docs/proton/INSTALL.md.

Manual install (any platform): `TpF2Multiplayer-files.zip` holds the files in the game-folder layout.

Fixes
- A resync or a frozen join (a player joining a running game) with three players failed with "Timed out waiting for all players": 15 seconds after loading the shared save, every game decided it was alone -- nobody had been heard from yet, because everyone was still loading -- dropped its hold and started playing, so the paused comparison never happened. The hold is now dropped only when the lobby that runs the operation is gone, or its roster says one player. The "alone in the game" behaviour from 0.6.1 (no world hash, the speed lever is yours) is unchanged.
