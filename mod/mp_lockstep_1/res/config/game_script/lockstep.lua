-- MP Lockstep -- the game-script half of TpF2 Multiplayer (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
--
-- Replicates COMMANDS, not state. Every command carries the game time at which
-- all peers must execute it; nobody executes early, including the originator.
-- Correctness rests on the simulation being deterministic, which was measured:
-- two instances, same save, 79 vehicles, 59/59 state hashes identical across 58
-- in-game days (docs/re/GAME_LOOP_AND_UI.md).
--
-- WHY GAME TIME IS THE CLOCK
-- Wall clock is useless -- the two processes are never in step, and one may be
-- paused. A per-instance tick counter is no better: it starts at load and
-- counts frames, so the same tick number means different world states. Game
-- time is part of the simulation, both instances load it from the same save,
-- and the determinism run showed it advances identically. So "execute at game
-- time T" names the SAME sim state on every peer, which is precisely what
-- lockstep needs.
--
-- Player commands reach this script through the slice DLL's inject file
-- (captured, and cancelled natively while a session is live); what travels,
-- and how each action is replayed, is in docs/REPLICATION.md.
--
-- LAYOUT (since 2026-09-08). This file is the entry point: constants (K), the
-- shared state table (CM), the command dispatcher, the desync check and data().
-- Everything else lives in res/scripts/mp/*.lua, each a factory
--     require("mp.<name>")(CM, K, log)
-- constructed in the order the sections used to sit in this file:
--   hash       exact hashing, game time, world hash, vehicle drift metric
--   io         runtime files (append/read), instance detection, wire broadcast
--   companies  multi-company mode
--   roads      road/track replay: command order, execEdge, execPolyline
--   geom       hermite, node/edge lookup, mid-span splitting
--   cons       constructions: hybrid replication, station edits, edge demolish, capture polls
--   vehicles   vehicle identity, names/colours, vehicle commands, buy, replace
--   lines      line identity, create/update/delete
--   conx       native construction replay (CONP/CONX), CONFAIL, LOAN
--   net        command reliability (NACK+resend), encode/decode, scheduleLocal, onLine
--   stops      roadside stops and native-shape stop replay
--   inject     the inject reader (pollInject)
--   pacing     session speed, PID pacing, catch-up, load gate
-- Every symbol used across module boundaries is a field of CM (CM.ticks,
-- CM.queue, CM.execLine, ...); a file-scope local is by construction private
-- to its module. Load-time order matters only for chunk-level statements
-- (pacing's exec_delay read calls CM.cfgFlag from stops, for instance); calls
-- between modules happen at runtime, after every factory has run.

-- ---------- runtime data directory ----------
-- Every runtime file (identity, events, captures, injects, status, logs) lives
-- in ONE directory shared with the bridge and slice DLLs; native/src/datadir.h
-- is the C++ half of this contract. Two candidates:
--   1. $TPF2MP_DATADIR             (a harness pin)
--   2. $LOCALAPPDATA/tpf2mp/data/  (shipping layout: Program Files is read-only
--                                   for the game process, LOCALAPPDATA is not)
-- The FIRST candidate holding tpf2_instance.txt wins: the bridge writes that
-- file at game start, so its presence proves the DLLs settled on that dir. If
-- none has it yet, 2 is used; with no readable LOCALAPPDATA either, loading
-- stops with a readable error rather than guessing a folder.
-- The game's Lua may lack 'os' entirely, hence the pcall around every getenv.
-- No new top-level locals (the chunk sits at Lua 5.1's 200-local limit): the
-- discovery is an immediately-invoked function and its bookkeeping lives in CM
-- (CM.baseSource = which candidate won, CM.baseCandidates = every candidate
-- dir, for readers that must look where a peer may have landed).
-- Constants and the per-instance file paths live here rather than as two
-- dozen more top-level locals: Lua allows 200 per chunk, and this file has
-- already hit that ceiling once, where the mod silently fails to load.

-- UNITS. getGameTime().time is NOT seconds: comparing a live reading (t=55234)
-- against the M3 probe's day counter (day=27617) puts it at ~2 units per
-- in-game DAY. The first draft used 30 here thinking it meant 30 seconds; it
-- would have been 15 game days, roughly seven minutes of waiting per command,
-- with desync checks 100 days apart. Everything below is in these units.
--
-- How far ahead commands are scheduled. Must exceed worst-case delivery
-- latency, which here is a file relay measured in milliseconds -- so ~2 game
-- days is enormous margin, and still under a minute of wall clock at speed 1.
-- MEASURED: 1 game-time unit is ~1.1s of wall clock at speed 1 (300 ticks took
-- 56s and advanced 50 units), so this delay IS the felt latency of a build.
--
-- What correctness needs is K.EXEC_DELAY > the peers' ACTUAL skew, and a
-- stamp also pays the fastest peer's lead (net.lua scheduleLocal). The !! LATE
-- warning measures the real skew -- if it starts firing, actual drift exceeds
-- the margin and the delay must go up. That is a measurement, not a guess.
-- MEASURED: the game clock is FRACTIONAL, advancing in steps of exactly 0.2
-- units (~0.22s wall clock) -- so sub-second stamps are possible. A single
-- sample at load read 55234.000000 and looked integer; it was just a round
-- value from the save. Step size is what settles resolution, not one reading.

-- AUTO DELAY (2026-09-11). Unless tpf2_slice.cfg pins exec_delay, the delay
-- follows the measured round trip to each peer (heartbeat echoes, CM.rttNote):
-- half the worst peer's smoothed round trip plus K.DELAY_DEV_MULT deviations and
-- a slack, converted to game units at the current sim rate, snapped up to the step
-- grid. K.EXEC_DELAY above is only the starting value until a peer has been
-- measured. It rises at once and falls one step at a time after K.DELAY_DOWN_TICKS.
--
-- ONE deviation, not two (first rig run, 2026-09-11): on one PC the round trip is
-- 200-300 ms of which almost all is each side waiting for its next script tick,
-- and that wait is uniformly jittery (+-60..160 ms). Two deviations sat the delay
-- at 0.6 with spikes to 1.0 while the fixed 0.4 before it never had a command
-- arrive late (13 saved runs, 300 RECVs: late 0 bar one catch-up, spare 0.00 in
-- ~5%). One deviation gives 0.4 there. Eight samples before trusting a peer: the
-- first few echoes straddle the load and read 500+-340 ms.
-- Floor 0.4, not 0.2: a command is only read on the receiver's next script tick
-- (about one sim step) wherever the peer is, and at 0.4 ~5% already arrived with
-- 0.00 to spare -- a calm 226+-28 ms sample would have picked 0.2 and run late.
