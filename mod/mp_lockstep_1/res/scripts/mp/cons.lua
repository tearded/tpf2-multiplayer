-- A FACTORY so each load of the game script gets fresh file-scope state.
-- Symbols shared between modules live in CM (CM.<name>); K is the constants

-- ---------- constructions: HYBRID replication ----------
--
-- Stations and depots cannot go through the strict capture-cancel-replay path
-- that roads use. Measured today: a script-built construction proposal is
-- rejected by make_cmd::BuildProposal itself (error `false`, hook never fires),
-- and the params.modules map is a native map<int, ModuleInfo> that is not in
-- the proposal bytes at all. So for constructions:
--
--   1. the ORIGINATOR lets the build happen locally (the hook does not cancel
--      caller 419f62), then reads fileName / params / transf back off the
--      resulting entity and schedules a CONP command carrying all three;
--   2. every peer replays it at the stamp with game.interface.buildConstruction
--      + setPlayer -- the path mp_bridge measured live, including a 16-module
--      modular station -- and the originator skips its own command.
--
-- Cost: the originator applies at T0 and peers at T (~0.7s later), so this is
-- not strict lockstep for constructions. Entity ids may differ across peers as
-- a result, which is consistent with the rest of the design: nothing addresses
-- a construction by id on the wire.
-- No depth cap. Until 2026-09-16 every table below depth 8 was SILENTLY written
-- as {} (K.MAX_SER_DEPTH), so a modded module's nested params reached the peers
-- empty and the edit looked identical on both sides while the worlds differed.
-- Engine params are a finite tree; the only thing recursion must guard against
-- is a CYCLE, which is a script bug and never engine data. The set of tables on
-- the current path catches it, and tripping it is LOGGED with the key path (and
-- counted in CM.serCycles) -- never a quiet {}. The same table under two keys (a
-- DAG) is not a cycle and serialises in full under each. The reader
-- (CM.deserParams) is a plain load() of the literal: no depth of ours there
-- either, and its one failure (the game parser's own nesting limit) is loud.
