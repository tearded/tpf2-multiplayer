-- measured 2026-08-28 (E2c: ok=true, entity created) -- as long as params
-- carry a seed. The 'factory rejects script constructions' finding of
-- 2026-08-17 was a stripped seed, nothing more. So the peer now issues the
-- SAME proposal the originator's UI issued: the construction plus, for CONX,
-- the captured street vectors verbatim (nodes, edges, removed edges). The
-- engine then does its own snapping/integration exactly as it did on the
-- originator, which is what buildConstruction (template at raw coordinates,
-- no integration) could never reproduce. Only positive ids need mapping:
-- the removed street edge is found under the split position, and its two
-- endpoints stand in for the originator's endpoint ids.
-- forward: execConX retries itself once after clearing a colliding town building.
-- The retry must NOT run in the same tick as the clearing bulldozes: those are
-- async commands, so an immediate retry validates against a world where the
-- buildings STILL EXIST (measured: 'cleared 3 -- retrying' then an instant
-- second Collision, while the later diagnostic scan found the footprint empty).
-- ONE construction replay in flight at a time. Placements are asynchronous: a
-- batch dropped in the same tick has every proposal validated against the world
-- as it was at submit time, so two depots splitting the same road (or adjacent
-- pieces of it) fight -- the second removes an edge the first has already
-- replaced and the engine rejects it with critical=true and NO message.
-- Measured 2026-08-30: five depots all stamped at=6.8, numbers 1, 2 and 5 built,
