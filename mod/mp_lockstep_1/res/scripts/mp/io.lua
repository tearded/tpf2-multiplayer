-- Split out of lockstep.lua on 2026-09-08. Loaded from the game script as
--     require("mp.io")(CM, K, log)
-- A FACTORY so each load of the game script gets fresh file-scope state.
-- Symbols shared between modules live in CM (CM.<name>); K is the constants
-- table, log the instance-tagged logger. Body kept at column 0 on purpose:
-- tools/luacheck.py's use-before-define checks look at column-0 declarations.

-- call in CM.syncTick raised "attempt to call field 'remove' (a nil value)" on a
-- player's host the moment a hot-join save was shared (0.4.11, build 35924,
-- 2026-09-10). Every pcall'd os.remove had been failing silently: stale dash and
-- status files from days before, and a fractional speed that was never cleared.
-- A file this mod wants gone is EMPTIED instead, and every reader treats an empty
-- file as absent: the bridge's tpf2_speed.txt ("absent, empty or 0 = off"), the
-- sync marker, the dash and status files. A missing file is not created.
