-- this many ticks of holding (~60 s). A friends' 4-player night (2026-09-09)
-- started with the host pressing play at "2 of 3 in": the third player was
-- still loading, missed a station placed at t=7, and every hash from t=16 on
-- disagreed -- 618 desync reports, stops on roads the host did not have,
-- vehicles 100 m apart. Nothing replays history to a player who arrives after
-- a command's stamp, so an early start is a guaranteed fork. Before the window

-- 2026-09-08: the host could not unpause the session from then on).

-- FRACTIONAL SPEEDS (2026-09-09). The engine's speed is a whole number of sim
-- iterations per frame; the bridge DLL's speedhook dithers that count per
-- frame to whatever number stands in DATADIR\tpf2_speed.txt (2.5 -> 2,3,2,3),
-- and the engine's own pause still wins. So a session speed of 2.5 is: lever
-- = round(2.5) so the UI shows something sane and the sim is not paused, plus
-- the file. A whole number clears the file and is the plain lever. The lever
-- is what getGameSpeed() reads back, so the "ours vs the player's" test keeps
-- comparing whole numbers.
-- A FRACTION NEVER MOVES THE LEVER (2026-09-09): the dither alone decides the
-- step count, so while the session speed is 2 and the PID asks for 1.7 or
-- 2.3 the lever stays at 2. Rounding the fraction to the nearest lever made
-- it flip between 1 and 2 as the PID crossed 1.5, and every flip plays the
-- game's speed-button click. The lever moves only when the session speed
-- itself changes (or for a pause / a whole-number target).

-- SPEED V2 controller (2026-09-10; the session speed a vote since 2026-09-15):
--   * the session speed is the mean of the players' speed votes (THE SESSION
--     SPEED IS THE PLAYERS' VOTE, above). While a session is live the slice DLL
--     cancels a click on the clock's controls (the speed buttons and the pause
--     toggle) and writes SPEEDBTN <v> <kind> to the inject file, so a click moves
--     no lever by itself (CM.speedButton). A lever change the slice did not
--     cancel (a game without hooks, the menu setting the speed as it switches to
--     the game) still reaches the leader's detector in CM.paceV2, and a new
--     speed there is the leader's vote.
--   * a PAUSE IS A SYNC POINT: when the session speed is 0 the leader stops
--     at once and everyone behind keeps running until they reach the
--     leader's clock, then stops there. So "pause to let people catch up"
--     does exactly that, and an unpause resumes everyone in step.
--   * nothing else moves the lever. The automatic corrections that were here
--     (leader micropause pulses, the hysteretic sustainable cap) throttled
--     and stuttered the session in ways players felt but could not see, and
--     are gone.
-- What remains automatic: the load gate, the catch-up of a game far behind,
-- and each joiner's PID trim toward the host's clock. Commands are stamped
-- past the fastest clock (net.lua), so a gap costs the slow player latency,
-- never a fork.
-- "/speed 2.5" typed in the lobby chat: the panel (menu DLL) writes speed=2.5
-- into tpf2_bridge_ctl.txt; the HOST reads it here as a session speed that
-- overrides the votes. Read every ~2 s, not per tick. "/speed off" (or 0) clears
-- it. The newer of the two wins: a vote that lands after a /speed request hands
