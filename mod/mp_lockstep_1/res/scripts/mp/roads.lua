-- instance, the originator included, and the replay passed gatherBuildings=false
-- with ignoreErrors=true. The engine records a colliding building only when
-- gatherBuildings is set (Context+0x00/+0x01 -> CollisionInfo, decompiled), so
-- with it off 'Collision' is raised as a NON-critical message, ignoreErrors
-- erases it, and the road is built straight through the building: nothing is
-- removed, on any instance. Setting the flag hands the decision back to the
-- engine, which derives the set at apply time from the proposal and that
-- instance's own world -- the same mechanism the strict construction replay uses
-- (conx.lua:644). Determinism comes from every instance running this one path.
--
-- NOT a general claim that nothing is removed today: a road that REMOVES an edge
-- (a split, an upgrade) already loses and relocates buildings through the engine's

-- answers, but it has no tolerance for a world that has drifted even slightly,
-- and it turns one drift into a cascade. Measured 2026-08-30: from a state whose
-- hashes agreed on every tick, seq=12 (2 points, 1 edge, no removals) was
-- accepted on the originator and refused on the peer, and every later build
-- failed too, because by then the two were resolving against different worlds.
--
-- So the originator decides, once, and ships the decisions. Positions, never
-- ids -- entity ids are per-instance, positions are the shared language this
-- wire already speaks (see the rm= removals). A peer that cannot match an entry
-- says so and falls back to deriving that one itself, which is strictly no

		-- polyline over an un-split road -- rejected, or built with no crossing.
		-- Recreate it from positions, like every other split: sample each rail
		-- segment's real Hermite curve, find a STREET edge under it interior to
		-- both, split that road there (ROAD-typed halves), and route the rail
		-- through the new node as two edges so the engine makes a real crossing.

		-- step straddles a 3 m band. So: enumerate street edges near the segment
		-- directly from the node->edge map, sample the ROAD's Hermite curve finely,
		-- and find the closest approach between the two curves. Accept when they
		-- come within CROSS_BAND, interior to both.
		-- How close the rail must pass to an EXISTING node before we will route
		-- it through that node. CROSS_BAND below is deliberately wide (a road's
		-- half-width plus margin) so a rail crossing a road's centreline is
