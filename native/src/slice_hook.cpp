// slice_hook -- the vertical slice: capture a player's road, cancel it locally,
// and hand it to the lockstep engine to execute on every peer at an agreed
// stamp.
//
// This is the first hook that closes the loop. defer_hook proved a build can be
// CANCELLED; args_probe proved the geometry can be READ; lockstep.lua proved a
// command can be EXECUTED at an agreed game time on both peers. Each worked
// alone and none of them were connected.
//
// WHY TWO HOOKS AND NOT ONE
// Cancelling at StreetBuilder::UpdateEngine (what defer_hook does) is fatal
// here: UpdateEngine is what CALLS make_cmd::BuildProposal, so suppressing it
// means the proposal is never built and there is nothing to read. Capture and
// cancel have to straddle the proposal's construction:
//
//     StreetBuilder::UpdateEngine 0x459ce0
//         -> make_cmd::BuildProposal 0x9dc750   (returns to 0x459e97)  CAPTURE
//         -> CommandList::Add        0x9d2a00   (returns to 0x459eb7)  CANCEL
//
// The two calls are consecutive statements in one function, so the geometry is
// fully formed at the first and the command has not yet been queued at the
// second.
//
// WHY CANCELLING AT CommandList::Add IS SAFE
// Its return value is discarded at this call site. Disassembled:
//     0x459eb2:  e8 49 8b 57 00     call 0x9d2a00
//     0x459eb7:  48 8d 4c 24 38     lea  rcx,[rsp+0x38]
// The next instruction loads rcx; nothing reads rax. Same property that made
// suppression safe at UpdateEngine, established the same way -- by reading the
// call site rather than assuming.
//
// WHY THE CALLER RVA FILTER IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT A TIDINESS CHECK
// CommandList::Add has 82 call sites and runs ~100/sec from the Lua bridge.
// The lockstep mod's own replicated builds go through it too. Suppressing on
// anything but caller_rva == 0x459eb7 would cancel the replay of the very
// command this hook just captured, and the road would vanish on both peers
// while the logs claimed success.
//
// ONE BEHAVIOUR, HARDCODED. While a session is live (SessionLive) a captured
// command is cancelled locally and replayed at the stamp on every instance;
// with no live session, or when a decode fails, it runs natively. A click on
// the clock's speed buttons is cancelled the same way and handed to the mod,
// whose leader makes it the session speed (CaptureSpeedButton). There is no
// observe mode and no per-channel switch: tpf2_slice.cfg carries only the
// dumpprop diagnostic, so a missing or garbled cfg cannot put this peer on a
// different protocol from the others.
