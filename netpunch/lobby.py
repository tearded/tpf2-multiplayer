lobby.py -- N-player LOBBY (usernames + roster + chat) over the netpunch engine.

This sits on top of the Phase 1-4 transport (``punch.py`` / ``observe.py`` /
``connect.py``) and turns a pile of hole-punched UDP links into a small,
host-authoritative lobby that the in-game Transport Fever 2 menu drives through
flat files.

TOPOLOGY -- host-as-relay star
------------------------------
The HOST is assumed reachable (open NAT). Every JOINER dials the host with the
existing connect race, so each joiner ends up with one ``punch.Connection`` to
the host. The host owns a SINGLE UDP socket and receives from ALL joiners on it;
it demultiplexes by source address (each distinct source == one peer). The host
is the authority for the roster and relays chat to everyone. No mesh, so it
scales to a handful of players without N^2 links.

Two layers ride the same ``NP1:`` wire:
  * the transport handshake (HELLO/ACK/CONNECTED/KEEPALIVE) -- reused verbatim
    from punch.py; the host replies to HELLO with ACK so joiners connect, and
    the joiner side is a stock ``Connection``.
  * the lobby protocol -- carried INSIDE ``TYPE_DATA`` payloads as one UTF-8
    JSON object with a ``"t"`` (type) field. This is the "extend NP1 with new
    types" the spec asks for: every lobby message is a real ``NP1:`` DATA frame,
    so ``Connection.send``/``recv`` on the joiner and ``_unpack`` on the host
    both handle it unchanged.

Lobby message types (the ``"t"`` field):
    join    {t:join, name, version}              joiner -> host (exact release match)
    welcome {t:welcome, you, host, version}      host -> one joiner (your final,
                                                  de-duplicated, username)
    roster  {t:roster, players[sorted], host,
             started, start_save}                 host -> all (also the ~2 s heal).
                                                  ``started`` is PER PEER: true only
                                                  if THAT joiner was included in a
                                                  start, so a joiner that missed the
                                                  start burst catches up from the
                                                  heal; ``start_save`` mirrors the
                                                  start's save flag.
    chat    {t:chat, from, text, ts, cid}        host -> all (relayed + stamped)
    chat    {t:chat, text}                        joiner -> host (host stamps it)
    ping    {t:ping}                              joiner -> host (fast keepalive)
    start   {t:start, save}                       host -> all (save=true when a save
                                                  transfer completed for that peer
                                                  this session; false = legacy
                                                  no-save start)
    status  {t:status, state, detail}             host -> one joiner (advisory; e.g.
                                                  a late joiner learns the game has
                                                  already started)
    leave   {t:leave}                             joiner -> host
    reject  {t:reject, reason}                    host -> one joiner (lobby full)
    bye     {t:bye}                               host -> all (lobby closing)

FILE-IPC CONTRACT (how the menu drives it -- kept EXACT)
--------------------------------------------------------
All three files live in the process CWD (override with --io-dir).

  lobby_out.jsonl   the lobby APPENDS newline-delimited JSON events:
      {"type":"code","code":"<base32>"}                 (host, once)
      {"type":"status","state":"waiting|connected|failed","detail":"..."}
      {"type":"roster","players":["alice","bob"],"you":"alice","host":"alice"}
      {"type":"chat","from":"bob","text":"hi","ts":<unix>}
      {"type":"start","save":true|false}
          save=true  -> load incoming_save.* (a save transfer completed);
          save=false -> legacy no-save start.
          A JOINER emits this ONLY when save==false, or save==true AND its
          receiver completed this session (it emitted save_ready). Any other
          start is logged and ignored WITHOUT latching 'started', so a later
          retried START GAME still works.
      {"type":"transfer","role":"send|recv",...}         (progress; per-peer on
          the host: "peer","pct" or "state":"done|failed|dropped")
      {"type":"save_ready","name":"incoming_save","dir":...,"files":[...]}
      {"type":"status","state":"failed",
       "detail":"save transfer failed for <names> -- press START GAME to retry"}
          (host, when ANY peer's transfer failed: the host does NOT broadcast
          start and clears the transfer so START GAME can be pressed again)
      {"type":"status","state":"connected",
       "detail":"game already started -- ask the host to press START GAME again"}
          (a LATE joiner -- one that joins after a start -- gets this instead
          of a start)
  lobby_state.json  a SINGLE JSON object, overwritten, mirroring the latest
      roster/state for easy polling:
      {"state","code","players","you","host","started"}
  lobby_in.jsonl    the menu APPENDS command lines; the lobby TAILS it (tracks a
      byte offset, processes only new whole lines) and acts on:
      {"cmd":"chat","text":"..."}     -> send CHAT
      {"cmd":"name","name":"..."}     -> change own username, re-JOIN/broadcast
      {"cmd":"start"}                 -> host broadcasts START save=false
                                         (no-op on a client)
      {"cmd":"start","save":<path>}   -> host pushes the save to every joiner,
                                         then broadcasts START save=true; with
                                         zero joiners it emits a status ('no
                                         players to share with') and does NOT
                                         start
      {"cmd":"quit"}                  -> leave cleanly

On startup both jsonl files are TRUNCATED so stale lines aren't reprocessed. A
JOINER also DELETES any stale incoming_save.sav / .sav.lua / .jpg in its io dir
before joining, so a previous session's save can never be mistaken for this one.

GAME RELAY (lockstep frames over the punched socket)
----------------------------------------------------
The lockstep bridge (tpf2_bridge_mp.dll) speaks plain point-to-point UDP to ONE
fixed peer address. To run it between two machines behind NAT with no new NAT
code, the menu points the bridge at 127.0.0.1:<game relay port> and the lobby
carries its frames over the socket it has ALREADY punched:

  bridge --UDP--> 127.0.0.1:P (this lobby) --NP1 DATA 'g'+frame--> peer lobby
         --UDP--> 127.0.0.1:L (the peer's bridge)

Enabled with ``--game-relay-port P --game-local-port L``:
  * a UDP socket is bound to 127.0.0.1:P; every datagram arriving there (from
    the local bridge) is forwarded over the lobby transport as a BINARY DATA
    payload whose first byte is ``GAME_RELAY_MAGIC`` (b'g' -- distinct from the
    '{' of JSON messages and the 'N' of CHUNK_MAGIC save chunks). The host
    forwards to every joiner; a joiner forwards to the host only.
  * any 'g' payload arriving from the transport is unwrapped and sent to
    127.0.0.1:L from that same socket.
  * frames over ``GAME_RELAY_MAX`` bytes are dropped with a stderr warning; a
    stats line (forwarded / delivered counts) goes to stderr every 10 s.
No ARQ here -- the bridge has its own. Without the flags nothing changes.
The menu passes P=7773 for HOST / 7774 for JOIN (distinct so two instances on
one machine can both run) and L = the port the bridge reported it bound.

RELAY-ONLY HOST (a dedicated server without a game)
----------------------------------------------------
``host --relay-only`` runs this same host loop on a machine with no game: it
is the star's centre (frames, chat, roster, save fan-out) and the master-server
announcer, but NOT a player. The oldest connected joiner is the LEADER: the
roster names it as ``host`` and carries ``relay: true`` plus a sticky
``letters`` map (name -> origin letter, a for the first joiner ever, never
reused while the relay lives), so the menu DLL gives the leader the host role
(START GAME, the hot-join sync save) and every bridge keeps its letter across
leader changes. The leader UPLOADS its save to the relay (the client-side
``start`` command drives a _HostSaveTransfer at the relay); the relay stores it
as its own incoming_save.* and pushes it to every peer that has not started,
then broadcasts ``start``. The leader accepts that start because it uploaded.

# receiver's buffer immediately, almost everything after the first few MB is
# dropped, the cumulative base never advances, and the transfer sits at 0% until
# it times out. Measured live 2026-09-07: a 114 MB save to a remote joiner made
# no progress at all, while the loopback selftest passed at 11 MB/s -- which is

    No hard size cap (real TF2 saves are ~200 MB); the whole concatenation is
    held in memory once and fanned out to every peer. Reliability is
    receiver-driven selective repeat:

      * the host streams chunks within a flow-control window (self.window);
      * each receiver periodically reports its cumulative ``base`` (every chunk
        below base is in hand) plus an explicit ``nack`` list of holes;
      * the host drops everything below base, retransmits NACKed chunks first,
        then sends new in-order chunks up to base+window;
      * if a receiver goes silent (its facks were lost) the host rewinds and
        re-streams the window, so it self-heals under ANY loss pattern.

    ``pump()`` sends at most SEND_BUDGET datagrams PER PEER, so it never hogs the
    single demux loop -- keepalives/roster for other peers keep flowing during a
    transfer. All ACK-side messages arrive through the host's normal recv path

        LOOPBACK ONLY, deliberately. An 8 KB datagram on a 1500-MTU LAN is IP
