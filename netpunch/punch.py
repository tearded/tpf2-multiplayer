"""
punch.py -- serverless UDP hole-punch engine (Phase 1 of netpunch).

This is the core transport used by the Transport Fever 2 co-op mod. Two peers
each bind a single UDP socket to a fixed local port and blast HELLO packets at
each other simultaneously. Whichever NAT sees the outbound packet first opens a
pinhole; the returning packet then flows through it. No server is involved.

Design notes
------------
* ONE socket per address family, bound to a fixed local port (default 29471).
  The public NAT mapping is per-socket, so everything (STUN, punch, gameplay)
  must run on the same socket for the mapping to line up. That's why
  ``Connection`` can adopt an already-bound socket handed in by observe.py.
* Simultaneous-send: send HELLO every 100 ms until connected. On any inbound
  packet, record its source as "the peer" -- always the *most recent* source, so
  we survive a NAT re-mapping mid-handshake.
* Handshake:  HELLO(token=ours) -> ACK(echoes sender's token) -> CONNECTED.
  A side declares success once it receives an ACK echoing ITS OWN token, which
  proves the peer actually heard us. Both sides independently reach that.
* Every packet is framed  MAGIC + TYPE + PAYLOAD  so stray UDP is ignored.
* After connect: KEEPALIVE every 15 s, and we track peer last-seen.

The whole packet lifecycle (handshake + steady state) lives in one reader
thread that owns the socket, so there's never a second reader stealing packets.
