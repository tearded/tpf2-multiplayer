"""The host's roster shows a joiner's save transfer from the host's OWN sender,
before the joiner reports anything, and the joiner's own report still wins.

Real ``lobby.run_host`` / ``lobby.run_client`` over loopback UDP, a real save
transfer, no game. What this checks (2026-09-16):

  a) while the save goes out, the host loop sets the peer's stage from its
     sender's 10% steps ("receiving save N%") -- seen in the host log as
     "stage <- sender" lines and in the roster events the host panel reads;
  b) once the peer verified the file the stage is "save received, loading",
     a text only the host side ever produces, and it stays until the joiner's
     DLL says what it is doing;
  c) a joiner's own {"cmd":"stage"} overrides it in the roster;
  d) the host's own {"cmd":"stage"} (its own load, a world switch) shows
     beside the host's name and "" clears it;
  e) the merge rule on its own: a joiner's "receiving save M%" at least as far
     along beats the sender's N%, an older one does not, "loading world ..."
     is never touched, and "done" replaces any receive text.
