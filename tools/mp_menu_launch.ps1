# mp_menu_launch.ps1 -- bring up A + sandboxed B and LEAVE THEM AT THE TITLE MENU.
#
# The Multiplayer lobby lives on the title screen (the in-frame Vulkan panel that
# menu_hook renders on main-menu page 2). autotest/mp_launch click CONTINUE and
# load a save, which navigates straight off that page -- wrong for a lobby demo.
# This launches both instances and STOPS at the menu so HOST/JOIN are reachable.
#
#   tools\mp_menu_launch.ps1            launch A + B to the title menu
#   tools\mp_menu_launch.ps1 -Solo      launch only instance A (host-side look)
#   tools\mp_menu_launch.ps1 -Players 3 launch A + B + C (C in Sandboxie box GameAgent2)
#
# Each extra player after B is one more Sandboxie box named GameAgent2, GameAgent3,
# ... (a copy of the GameAgent box's settings in C:\Windows\Sandboxie.ini). Boxes
# isolate the game's files, mutex and data dir; they do NOT isolate the network,
# so the bridge and the menu pick free loopback ports per instance.
#
# A FRESH box needs two things before its game stays up (learned 2026-09-01):
#   1. the first launch only starts the boxed Steam and exits; launch again.
#   2. the boxed Steam then blocks on a Steam Cloud "pending sessions" prompt
#      because the other instances hold the game's cloud session. Stop that box
#      (Start.exe /box:<box> /terminate -- ONLY the new box) and put
#      "cloudenabled" "0" in the game's block of the box's
#      userdata\<id>\config\localconfig.vdf. After that it launches like B.
