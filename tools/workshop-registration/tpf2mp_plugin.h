// tpf2mp_plugin.h -- the plugin ABI.
//
// This is the ONLY file a plugin needs from the host. Plugins live in their own
// repositories and VENDOR a copy of this header; there is no build-time coupling
// between a plugin and the host tree, and no submodule.
//
// A plugin is a DLL in <datadir>\plugins\ (or <gamedir>\tpf2mp\plugins\) that
// exports:
//
//     extern "C" __declspec(dllexport)
//     int Tpf2mpPluginInit(const Tpf2mpHost* host, Tpf2mpPluginInfo* out);
//
// It is called ONCE, on the proxy's loader thread, before the exe entry point
// has run -- so a plugin may patch code, but must not assume the game's own
// subsystems exist yet. Return TPF2MP_OK to stay loaded; anything else and the
// host logs the reason and leaves the plugin inert (it is not unloaded, because
// unloading a DLL that has already patched code is worse than leaving it).
//
// WHY AN ABI AND NOT JUST A HEADER SHARED BY BUILD
// The host and a plugin are compiled separately, possibly by different people
// with different compiler versions. Everything crossing this boundary is plain
// C: no std::, no exceptions, no ownership transfer. The host owns every pointer
// it hands out and keeps it alive for the life of the process.
